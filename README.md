# Getting Started
## Prerequsites
You just have a basic knowledge about the above mentioned languages and XAMPP (Local hosting software).

## Installation
Step 1: <br />
  Fork this repository, and clone it into your local machine. <br />
  ```  git clone https://github.com/vk-vasanth-vk/Animot.git ``` using this command on your command prompt. <br />
  you can use any code editor.

Step 2: <br />
  * Install and setup the XAMPP server to run your application on localhost.
  * Just go through the official docs or watch some Youtube videos for basic controls.
  * Always make sure that your files are inside the Xampp/htdocs folder, to host your application.
  * Now, run the Apache(Server) and MySQL(DB) from the control panel.

Step 3:
  * Head to localhost/phpmyadmin in your browser
  * Create a new Database
  * Create a new table to store the username and password (column name should be username and password)
  * Create a connection.php file to establish a connection with your DB
  * You can able to see the application on ``` localhost:<your_project_directory>/<your_file_name> ```

Step 4: <br />
  There might be some conflicts with the file path since i'm uploaded only the pages folder and you can't able to see any images or background videos. <br />
  For resouces send me a request on this google drive link ``` https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jzbNxoulzyn4NgzTGGepZ_smITqp-RDG?usp=sharing ```.
  Add this to the project folder and now you can able to see the videos and images.

# Limitations and Future Plans
  As this is my first web project, i developed this with raw HTML,CSS,PHP and without the help of any modern framworks, so the code structure and the naming conventions might be little bit terrible, Sry for that.
  It only contains limited resources, 3 pages for each categories. I'm planning to integrate API to provide more contents and details in the future, and also moving to modern web technologies to make more responsive pages. Contributions are welcomed!

# Need a help ?
